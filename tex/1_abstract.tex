\section*{Abstract}

The goal of this thesis is to analyse a part of the law about judgement issuing. We analyzed the law using OER method while focusing on ontological transactions. While analyzing the text and constructing transaction tables, we discovered that a lot of things are mising or things are tacid. From the tables we created Interaction Structure Model diagram, OCD diagram and OFD diagram. A part of the analyzed model was modeled in BPMN in Camunda platform.
